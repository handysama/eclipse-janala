eclipse-janala
==============

eclipse plugin for janala2 (https://github.com/ksen007/janala2)

This plugin is based on Randoop plugin. This project aims to help developer to launch janala2 from eclipse.
Execution sequence is based on janala2's original python script.
Next iteration will decouple Randoop API and create independent plugin.
Any suggestion and advice are welcome. Thank you!
